		/*Question-7

		Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a single dollar bill to pay for the item.

		      Sample output

		      Price in cents : 95

		      Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickles*/
